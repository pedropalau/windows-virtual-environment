# windows-virtual-environment

This repository was born as some testing work we are doing locally. To help others, I wanted to make it public.

The idea behind this is to build to a VirtualBox image, the official [Windows Server 2019](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/win/Windows2019-Readme.md) virtual environment used by GitHub Actions.

Based on [https://github.com/eaksel/packer-Win2019](https://github.com/eaksel/packer-Win2019).
